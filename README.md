# Data-Driven-Optimization-of-Patient-Care-Pathways-and-Hospital-Resource-Utilization
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project leverages historical patient data to extract meaningful insights into hospital admissions, departmental service demand, and discharge outcomes. 
By examining key variables such as condition types, age groups, length of stay, and discharge status, I aim to identify trends and patterns that influence hospital efficiency and patient care. 
The analysis will support data-informed decisions in resource planning, patient flow management, and clinical service delivery, ultimately contributing to improved healthcare outcomes and operational effectiveness.
### PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Hospitals operate in a high-pressure environment where timely decisions and efficient resource use are critical to delivering quality care.
However, limited utilisation of patient-level data often hampers visibility into operational bottlenecks, prolonged hospital stays, and uneven departmental loads. 
Without a clear understanding of how different patient demographics and conditions affect care pathways, healthcare facilities risk inefficiencies and suboptimal outcomes. 
This project seeks to harness patient data to uncover actionable insights that can drive better resource planning, optimise care delivery across departments, and improve discharge planning strategies.
### KEY BUSINESS QUESTIONS
1.	Which departments handle the highest volume of patients?
2.	 What are the most common medical conditions treated in the hospital?
3.	What is the average length of stay per condition type?
4.	Which age group accounts for the longest average stays?
5.	Are certain conditions more prevalent in specific age groups?
6.	What are the trends in inpatient admissions over time (monthly or seasonally)?
7.	What proportion of patients are discharged home vs. transferred to rehab?
8.	Which departments have the highest rate of patient transfers to rehab?
### METHODOLOGY
#### TOOL USED: Microsoft Excel
#### DATA CLEANING PROCESS AND TRANSFORMATION: 
- I ensured that there were no duplicates, inconsistencies or errors, and I ensured the datatypes were correct  
### DATA ANALYSIS
- I used the key business question for my analysis, which includes average length of stay, monthly trends of patients admitted and soon
- I make use of a pivot table, which makes my analysis very easy
#### INSIGHT
1. General Medicine sees more than 50% of total patients, suggesting it is the core driver of hospital activity.
2. Pneumonia and Stroke cases dominated, which can vary across different age groups, with implications for seasonal and emergency care planning.
3. Alzheimer's and Fracture(Hip) conditions result in longer stays.  These cases require significant care and planning for discharge or rehabilitation..
4. Older patients (61+) stay significantly longer, likely due to more complex or chronic conditions like Alzheimer's, Fracture(Hip), Stroke.
5. There may be seasonal surges, possibly related to infectious diseases or environmental conditions.
6. Over a quarter of patients need post-hospital care, emphasising the need for effective discharge planning
7. In the ICU department, there is the highest rate of patient transfer to Rehab 
8. Over 1 in 4 patients require continued care after discharge, indicating a notable demand for rehabilitation services
#### RECOMMENDATION

- Strengthen staffing and resources in General Medicine, as it serves most patients.
- Prepare specialised care pathways for Orthopaedics and ICU, which also handle substantial volumes.
- Allocate additional rehab and long-term care resources for chronic conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's and Stroke).
- Implement seasonal preparedness protocols, especially for March and May surges.
- Invest in geriatric care services and proactively plan for the discharge of elderly and chronic-condition patients by integrating social workers and rehab coordination earlier
- Strengthen relationships with rehab centres and home-care providers due to the 26% post-hospital care requirement, and add a monitoring tool to track readmissions and rehab outcomes for discharged patients.
- Segment high-risk conditions (e.g., Stroke, Pneumonia) for early intervention and case management.
